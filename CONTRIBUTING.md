## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct:

- Be respectful and inclusive

- Help others learn and grow
- Maintain professionalism in all interactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm 8.0.0 or higher
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended with TypeScript support)

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vantage_vertical_web.git
   cd vantage_vertical_web
   ```

3. Add the original repository as upstream:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Pronothurah/vantage_vertical_web.git
   ```

## Development Setup

1. Run the automated setup script (recommended):
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   Or set up manually:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Set up environment variables
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

The development server includes:
- Hot module replacement for instant updates
- TypeScript compilation and type checking
- Tailwind CSS processing
- API routes for contact forms

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming Convention

Create descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-user-authentication`
- `bugfix/fix-contact-form-validation`
- `docs/update-api-documentation`
- `refactor/optimize-image-loading`

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of what was changed and why.

- List any breaking changes
- Reference issue numbers if applicable
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(contact): add email validation to contact form

- Added regex validation for email format
- Added error message display
- Updated form styling for error states

Fixes #123
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/React

- Use TypeScript for all new code with proper type definitions
- Follow React Hooks patterns and Next.js best practices
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use meaningful variable and function names with type annotations
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions and components
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions for routing and layouts

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Follow the existing design system and brand colors
- Ensure responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- Optimize for performance and accessibility
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA compliance guidelines

### API Routes (Next.js)

- Use Next.js API routes for server-side functionality
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Use TypeScript for request/response types
- Follow RESTful conventions where applicable
- Handle CORS and security headers appropriately

### File Organization

- Follow Next.js App Router structure (src/app/)
- Keep components small, focused, and reusable
- Use TypeScript interfaces in src/types/
- Organize components by feature in src/components/
- Use index.ts files for clean exports
- Keep utilities in src/lib/ with proper typing

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for utility functions and components
- Add integration tests for complex user interactions
- Test form submissions and API route functionality
- Ensure accessibility compliance with testing-library
- Use TypeScript for test files with proper typing
- Mock external dependencies and API calls
- Test responsive behavior and mobile interactions

### Test Structure

- Place tests in `src/__tests__/` or alongside components as `*.test.tsx`
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks

### Manual Testing

Before submitting:
- Test on different screen sizes and devices
- Verify form submissions work correctly
- Check navigation and routing functionality
- Test with different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Validate static site generation with `npm run build`
- Test deployment build locally
