## Making Changes

### Branch Naming Convention

Create descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-user-authentication`
- `bugfix/fix-contact-form-validation`
- `docs/update-api-documentation`
- `refactor/optimize-image-loading`

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of what was changed and why.

- List any breaking changes
- Reference issue numbers if applicable
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/React

- Use ES6+ features
- Follow React Hooks patterns
- Use functional components over class components
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### CSS

- Use the existing CSS custom properties system
- Follow BEM naming convention for new classes
- Ensure responsive design principles
- Optimize for performance (avoid unnecessary reflows)

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

- Use async/await over callbacks
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Use middleware appropriately

### File Organization

- Keep components small and focused
- Use index.js files for clean imports
- Organize files by feature, not by type
- Keep assets organized in appropriate folders

## Testing

### Frontend Testing

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Add integration tests for complex components
- Test user interactions and form submissions
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### Backend Testing

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

- Test API endpoints
- Validate database operations
- Test error handling scenarios
- Mock external dependencies

### Manual Testing

Before submitting:
- Test on different screen sizes
- Verify form submissions work
- Check navigation and routing
- Test with different browsers
- Validate MongoDB connections
