  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Implement scroll state management and indicators
  - Create scroll state tracking to detect when content exceeds container height
  - Add visual scroll indicators (scrollbar) that appear only when content is scrollable
  - Implement scroll boundary detection to provide visual feedback at top/bottom
  - Add scroll position tracking for accessibility announcements
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Enhance keyboard navigation for scrollable menu
  - Update existing keyboard event handlers to work with scrollable container
  - Implement automatic scrolling to keep focused menu items visible
  - Add Home/End key support to jump to first/last menu items with scroll
  - Ensure Tab navigation works properly within the scrollable area
  - Maintain existing focus trapping functionality with scroll support
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.2_

- [x] 5. Add touch gesture support and momentum scrolling
  - Implement native touch scrolling with proper momentum on mobile devices
  - Ensure touch events don't conflict with page scrolling when menu is open
  - Add support for swipe gestures within the menu container
  - Test and optimize touch responsiveness across different mobile browsers
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Implement accessibility enhancements for scrollable menu
  - Add ARIA attributes to indicate scrollable content and current scroll state
  - Implement screen reader announcements for scroll availability and boundaries
  - Add support for reduced motion preferences in scroll animations
  - Ensure proper focus management when scrolling with assistive technologies
  - Test compatibility with screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack, NVDA)
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 7. Optimize performance and add error handling
  - Implement passive event listeners for scroll events to improve performance
  - Add debouncing for resize calculations and scroll state updates
  - Implement error boundaries for height calculation failures
  - Add performance monitoring to maintain 60fps during scroll operations
  - Ensure proper cleanup of event listeners and DOM references
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5_

- [x] 8. Create comprehensive tests for mobile menu scrolling
  - Write unit tests for height calculation utilities and scroll state management
  - Create integration tests for touch scrolling behavior on different screen sizes
  - Add accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
  - Implement visual regression tests to ensure design consistency is maintained
  - Test performance under various conditions (large menus, slow devices, etc.)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1_

- [x] 9. Test across devices and browsers
  - Test scrollable menu functionality on various mobile devices (iOS, Android)
  - Verify behavior across different mobile browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
  - Test on tablets in both portrait and landscape orientations
  - Validate accessibility features with actual assistive technologies
  - Perform user acceptance testing with real mobile users
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 3.1, 3.3, 4.5, 5.4_

- [x] 10. Document implementation and create troubleshooting guide
  - Update component documentation to reflect new scrollable functionality
