# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the mobile navigation menu scrolling issue on the Vantage Vertical website. Currently, when users open the mobile navigation menu (breadcrumb) on tablet and mobile devices, they cannot scroll through the navigation items, causing some menu items to be hidden and inaccessible. This fix will ensure all navigation items are accessible on mobile devices by implementing proper scrolling functionality within the mobile menu container.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mobile Menu Scrolling Implementation

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to be able to scroll through all navigation items in the mobile menu, so that I can access every page of the website regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the mobile navigation menu THEN the system SHALL allow vertical scrolling within the menu container if content exceeds the visible area
2. WHEN a user scrolls within the mobile menu THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling behavior with appropriate momentum
3. WHEN the mobile menu content fits within the viewport THEN the system SHALL not show scroll indicators or allow scrolling
4. WHEN the mobile menu content exceeds the viewport height THEN the system SHALL show visual scroll indicators (scrollbar) to indicate more content is available
5. WHEN a user reaches the top or bottom of the scrollable menu THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback to indicate the scroll boundary

### Requirement 2: Responsive Height Management

**User Story:** As a mobile user on different device sizes, I want the mobile menu to adapt its height appropriately, so that I can access all menu items regardless of my device's screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the mobile menu on a small mobile device THEN the system SHALL limit the menu height to prevent it from covering the entire screen
2. WHEN a user opens the mobile menu on a tablet THEN the system SHALL allow more menu height while still maintaining usability
3. WHEN calculating menu height THEN the system SHALL consider the device viewport height and reserve space for the navbar header
4. WHEN the menu opens THEN the system SHALL ensure at least 20% of the screen remains visible below the menu for context
5. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL recalculate and adjust the menu height accordingly

### Requirement 3: Touch and Accessibility Support

**User Story:** As a mobile user with accessibility needs, I want the scrollable mobile menu to work with touch gestures and assistive technologies, so that I can navigate the website effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uses touch gestures to scroll THEN the system SHALL respond to swipe gestures with natural momentum scrolling
2. WHEN a user uses assistive technology THEN the system SHALL maintain proper focus management within the scrollable area
3. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to keep the focused item visible
4. WHEN a user with reduced motion preferences views the menu THEN the system SHALL respect their motion preferences for scrolling animations
5. WHEN a user interacts with the scrollable menu THEN the system SHALL maintain proper ARIA attributes and screen reader announcements

### Requirement 4: Visual Design Consistency

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the scrollable mobile menu to maintain the existing visual design and branding, so that the user experience remains consistent with the rest of the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mobile menu becomes scrollable THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing styling, colors, and typography
2. WHEN scroll indicators are shown THEN they SHALL use colors and styling consistent with the website's design system
3. WHEN the menu is scrolling THEN the system SHALL maintain the backdrop blur and transparency effects
4. WHEN menu items are partially visible during scrolling THEN they SHALL maintain proper visual hierarchy and readability
5. WHEN the scrollable menu is displayed THEN it SHALL preserve the existing hover states and active link indicators

### Requirement 5: Performance and Smooth Operation

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the scrollable mobile menu to perform smoothly without lag or stuttering, so that my navigation experience is pleasant and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls through the mobile menu THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance during scroll operations
2. WHEN the mobile menu opens THEN the system SHALL render the scrollable container without noticeable delay
3. WHEN a user performs rapid scroll gestures THEN the system SHALL handle them smoothly without performance degradation
4. WHEN the menu is scrolling THEN the system SHALL not interfere with the page's main scroll behavior
5. WHEN multiple touch interactions occur THEN the system SHALL properly handle touch events without conflicts
