# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Restructure blog post page layout to fix image positioning
  - Modify the article header section in `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` to move featured image before social share
  - Split the current single header section into three logical sections: title area, featured image, and meta/social area
  - Update the JSX structure to eliminate the large gap between social share and content
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1_

- [x] 2. Optimize spacing system throughout blog layout
  - Replace excessive `mb-12` spacing with more balanced `mb-8` spacing between major sections
  - Implement consistent vertical rhythm using the defined spacing scale (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
  - Add responsive spacing adjustments for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
  - Test spacing with various content lengths to ensure consistency
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Enhance featured image component with better positioning and error handling
  - Create a dedicated `FeaturedImageSection` component for better reusability and maintainability
  - Implement improved error handling with proper fallback image loading
  - Add responsive aspect ratio adjustments (16:9 for desktop/tablet, 4:3 for mobile)
  - Ensure proper alt text and accessibility attributes are maintained
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 5.3_

- [ ] 4. Update social share component integration for new layout position
  - Modify the social share component positioning to work better in the new layout structure
  - Ensure social share buttons maintain proper touch targets and spacing on mobile devices
  - Add variant prop to `SocialShare` component to handle different positioning contexts
  - Test social sharing functionality remains intact after layout changes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 5. Implement responsive design improvements for mobile and tablet
  - Add mobile-specific spacing adjustments using Tailwind responsive prefixes
  - Optimize featured image aspect ratios for different screen sizes
  - Ensure social share buttons stack properly on smaller screens
  - Test touch interactions and accessibility on mobile devices
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.5, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Add CSS classes and styling for improved visual hierarchy
  - Create utility classes for consistent blog layout spacing
  - Implement smooth transitions for image loading to prevent layout shift
  - Add proper semantic HTML structure for better screen reader navigation
  - Ensure typography hierarchy flows naturally from title through content
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.3_

- [ ] 7. Implement performance optimizations to prevent layout shift
  - Add proper image dimensions and aspect ratio containers to prevent CLS
  - Implement skeleton loading states for featured images during load
  - Optimize image loading priority and lazy loading behavior
  - Add error boundaries for graceful handling of image loading failures
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.5, 1.4_

- [ ] 8. Update blog layout configuration and make it maintainable
  - Create a centralized blog layout configuration object for spacing and breakpoints
  - Extract magic numbers into named constants for better maintainability
  - Add TypeScript interfaces for blog layout props and configuration
  - Document the new layout structure for future developers
  - _Requirements: 4.5, 5.2_

- [ ] 9. Test layout changes across different content scenarios
  - Test blog posts with various title lengths and excerpt sizes
  - Verify layout works with different featured image aspect ratios and sizes
  - Test with missing or broken featured images to ensure fallback behavior
  - Validate layout with different author information and social sharing configurations
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 3.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 10. Conduct accessibility and performance validation
  - Run screen reader tests to ensure proper reading order with repositioned elements
  - Verify keyboard navigation works correctly through the new layout structure
  - Test Core Web Vitals impact, especially Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
  - Validate WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all interactive elements in new positions
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_
