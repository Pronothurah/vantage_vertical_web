# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the blog post layout on the Vantage Vertical website. Currently, there is excessive spacing between the social media sharing icons and the blog content, with the featured image positioned after the social share component creating an awkward visual gap. This optimization aims to improve the visual flow and user experience of blog posts by repositioning the featured image and optimizing spacing throughout the blog layout.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Featured Image Positioning

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want to see the featured image prominently displayed near the article title, so that I can quickly understand the visual context of the article before reading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a blog post THEN the system SHALL display the featured image immediately after the article title and excerpt, before the social sharing buttons
2. WHEN a user scrolls through the blog post THEN the system SHALL ensure the featured image serves as a visual separator between the header content and social/meta information
3. WHEN the featured image loads THEN the system SHALL maintain proper aspect ratio and responsive behavior across all device sizes
4. WHEN a featured image fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate fallback image related to drone services
5. WHEN a user views the blog post THEN the system SHALL ensure the featured image has proper alt text for accessibility

### Requirement 2: Spacing and Layout Optimization

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want consistent and visually pleasing spacing throughout the blog post, so that the content is easy to read and navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a blog post THEN the system SHALL reduce excessive spacing between the social sharing component and the blog content
2. WHEN a user reads the blog post THEN the system SHALL provide consistent vertical spacing between all major sections (header, image, social share, content, tags, author bio)
3. WHEN a user views the blog on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure spacing scales appropriately for smaller screens
4. WHEN a user scrolls through the blog THEN the system SHALL maintain visual hierarchy with proper spacing that guides the eye naturally from title to content
5. WHEN a user interacts with the blog layout THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements (social share buttons, tags, links) have adequate touch targets and spacing

### Requirement 3: Social Share Component Enhancement

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want social sharing options that are easily accessible but don't interfere with the reading experience, so that I can share content when desired without visual distraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a blog post THEN the system SHALL position social sharing buttons in a logical location that doesn't create large visual gaps
2. WHEN a user wants to share content THEN the system SHALL provide social sharing options that are visually integrated with the overall blog design
3. WHEN a user views the social sharing component THEN the system SHALL ensure it uses consistent styling with the rest of the blog layout
4. WHEN a user interacts with social sharing buttons THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate hover states and visual feedback
5. WHEN a user views the blog on different devices THEN the system SHALL ensure social sharing buttons remain accessible and properly sized

### Requirement 4: Visual Hierarchy Improvement

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want a clear visual hierarchy that guides me through the content naturally, so that I can easily consume the information in the intended order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a blog post THEN the system SHALL establish clear visual hierarchy: title → excerpt → featured image → meta info → social share → content
2. WHEN a user scans the blog post THEN the system SHALL use typography, spacing, and visual elements to create natural reading flow
3. WHEN a user views multiple blog elements THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent visual treatment of similar components (author info, meta data, tags)
4. WHEN a user reads the blog content THEN the system SHALL provide clear separation between the article header area and the main content area
5. WHEN a user navigates through the blog THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency with the overall website design system

### Requirement 5: Performance and Accessibility

**User Story:** As any blog reader, I want the blog layout to load quickly and be accessible regardless of my abilities or device, so that I can access the content without barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads a blog post THEN the system SHALL ensure layout changes don't negatively impact page load performance
2. WHEN users with disabilities access the blog THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards for all layout elements
3. WHEN screen readers access the blog THEN the system SHALL provide proper semantic structure and reading order
4. WHEN users navigate with keyboards THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements remain accessible in the new layout
5. WHEN the blog layout renders THEN the system SHALL prevent layout shift and maintain stable visual positioning during load
