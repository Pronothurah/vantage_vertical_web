# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on systematically identifying and resolving all build and lint errors in the Next.js TypeScript webapp to ensure a clean, production-ready codebase. The webapp appears to be a drone services company website with multiple forms, email integration, and various pages. Currently, there may be TypeScript compilation errors, ESLint violations, and build configuration issues that need to be addressed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors resolved, so that the application builds successfully without type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run type-check` THEN the system SHALL complete without any TypeScript errors
2. WHEN building the application with `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL compile all TypeScript files successfully
3. WHEN opening the project in VS Code THEN the system SHALL show no TypeScript errors in the Problems panel
4. IF there are missing type definitions THEN the system SHALL install appropriate @types packages
5. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL resolve all import paths correctly using the configured path aliases

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all ESLint violations fixed, so that the code follows consistent style and quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run lint` THEN the system SHALL complete without any linting errors
2. WHEN running `npm run lint:fix` THEN the system SHALL automatically fix all auto-fixable issues
3. WHEN viewing code in the editor THEN the system SHALL show no ESLint warnings or errors
4. IF there are unused imports or variables THEN the system SHALL remove or mark them appropriately
5. WHEN code violates formatting rules THEN the system SHALL apply consistent formatting using Prettier

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to complete successfully, so that the application can be deployed without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL generate the production build without errors
2. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL create the `out/` directory with static files for Netlify deployment
3. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL optimize all images and assets correctly
4. IF there are missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify and install them
5. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL respect the Next.js configuration for static export

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import/export issues resolved, so that modules are properly connected and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing components THEN the system SHALL resolve all relative and absolute imports correctly
2. WHEN using path aliases (@/*) THEN the system SHALL map them to the correct source directories
3. IF there are circular dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify and resolve them
4. WHEN exporting modules THEN the system SHALL use consistent export patterns throughout the codebase
5. WHEN importing external libraries THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment configuration issues resolved, so that the application runs correctly in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the development server THEN the system SHALL load environment variables from .env correctly
2. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL handle environment variables appropriately for static export
3. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN deploying to Netlify THEN the system SHALL work with the configured environment variables
5. WHEN running in different environments THEN the system SHALL respect NODE_ENV settings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all component and API route errors fixed, so that all features work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering React components THEN the system SHALL display them without runtime errors
2. WHEN calling API routes THEN the system SHALL handle requests and responses correctly
3. IF there are prop type mismatches THEN the system SHALL fix the type definitions
4. WHEN using hooks THEN the system SHALL follow React hooks rules correctly
5. WHEN handling forms THEN the system SHALL process submissions without errors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dependency issues resolved, so that all required packages are properly installed and compatible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL resolve all package versions without conflicts
2. WHEN running the application THEN the system SHALL have access to all required dependencies
3. IF there are peer dependency warnings THEN the system SHALL resolve them appropriately
4. WHEN updating packages THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing codebase
5. WHEN checking for vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL have no high-severity security issues
