# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing and standardizing SMTP email integration across the Vantage Vertical website. While contact forms and newsletter subscriptions are already functional, drone inquiries and training enrollment forms need to be completed to ensure all client communications reach the designated email address (vantagevarticalltd@gmail.com). The system also needs consistent error handling, retry logic, and performance optimizations across all email endpoints.
