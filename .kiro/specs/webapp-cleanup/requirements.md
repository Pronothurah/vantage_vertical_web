# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the cleanup and optimization of the Vantage Vertical webapp now that it has been converted from a multi-folder structure (backend/frontend) to a unified Next.js application. The goal is to remove outdated files, update documentation, and create a modern setup script appropriate for the current architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Outdated Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove files that are no longer relevant to the Next.js architecture, so that the project structure is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing project files THEN the system SHALL identify and remove MongoDB-related documentation that is no longer needed
2. WHEN cleaning up test files THEN the system SHALL remove HTML test files that were used for development but are no longer needed
3. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL remove or update files that reference the old backend/frontend structure
4. WHEN cleaning build artifacts THEN the system SHALL remove unnecessary build files and cache directories
5. WHEN reviewing configuration THEN the system SHALL remove configurations that are specific to the old architecture

### Requirement 2: Update Setup Script

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the project, I want a modern setup script that reflects the current Next.js architecture, so that I can quickly get the development environment running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the setup script THEN it SHALL check for Node.js and npm/yarn availability
2. WHEN setting up dependencies THEN the script SHALL install only Next.js project dependencies
3. WHEN configuring environment THEN the script SHALL set up only the necessary .env file for Next.js
4. WHEN providing instructions THEN the script SHALL give accurate commands for the current architecture
5. WHEN completing setup THEN the script SHALL provide clear next steps for development and deployment

### Requirement 3: Update Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer or contributor, I want updated documentation that accurately reflects the current Next.js architecture, so that I can understand and contribute to the project effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading README.md THEN it SHALL accurately describe the Next.js project structure
2. WHEN following setup instructions THEN they SHALL be relevant to the current architecture
3. WHEN reviewing deployment docs THEN they SHALL reflect the static export and Netlify deployment process
4. WHEN checking contributing guidelines THEN they SHALL be updated for the Next.js development workflow
5. WHEN viewing project documentation THEN it SHALL remove references to MongoDB and backend services

### Requirement 4: Optimize Project Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an optimized project structure that follows Next.js best practices, so that the codebase is organized and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project root THEN it SHALL contain only necessary configuration files
2. WHEN examining build outputs THEN unnecessary build artifacts SHALL be removed
3. WHEN checking dependencies THEN only required packages SHALL be present in package.json
4. WHEN reviewing environment configuration THEN it SHALL be simplified for the static site architecture
5. WHEN assessing file organization THEN it SHALL follow Next.js conventions and best practices

### Requirement 5: Create Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear development and deployment workflows, so that I can efficiently work on and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting development THEN the workflow SHALL provide clear commands for local development
2. WHEN building for production THEN the process SHALL generate optimized static files
3. WHEN deploying THEN the workflow SHALL support Netlify deployment
4. WHEN testing THEN the setup SHALL support the existing Jest testing framework
5. WHEN maintaining code quality THEN the workflow SHALL include linting and type checking
