## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9.0 or higher
- npm 8.0.0 or higher

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Pronothurah/vantage_vertical_web.git
cd vantage_vertical_web

# Run the setup script (recommended)
./setup.sh

# Or install manually
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build        # Create the static export (outputs to out/)
npm run start        # Serve the built out/ directory locally (run build first)

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # Run ESLint for code quality
npm run type-check   # Run TypeScript type checking
npm test             # Run Jest test suite
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report

# Email
npm run test:email        # Send a real test email using the configured SMTP settings
npm run test:email-config # Validate SMTP configuration without sending an email

# Deployment
npm run netlify-build # Build for Netlify deployment
```

> **Note:** This app uses `output: 'export'` (static export), so `next start` cannot run it as a server. `npm start` instead serves the static `out/` directory with [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve) — the same output Netlify deploys.

### Development Server

The development server will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with:
- Hot module replacement for instant updates
- TypeScript compilation
- Tailwind CSS processing
- API routes for contact forms (dev-server only — see note below)

> **Note:** The `src/app/api/*` routes only run under `npm run dev`. The production site is a static export (`output: 'export'`) with no Node server, so these routes are not deployed and form submissions do not currently reach them in production.
