# Mobile Navbar Scrolling Implementation

## Overview

This documentation covers the implementation of scrollable functionality in the mobile navigation menu of the Vantage Vertical website. The solution provides responsive, accessible, and performant scrolling for mobile and tablet devices when navigation items exceed the visible area.

## Quick Start

The mobile navbar scrolling is automatically enabled when the mobile menu is opened. No additional configuration is required for basic functionality.

```tsx
import { Navbar } from '@/components/layout';

// The Navbar component includes all scrolling functionality
export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <header>
      <Navbar />
    </header>
  );
}
```

## Key Features

- **Responsive Height Calculation**: Automatically adjusts menu height based on device type and viewport
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Native smooth scrolling with momentum support
- **Touch Gesture Support**: Optimized touch interactions for mobile devices
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enhanced keyboard navigation with automatic scrolling
- **Accessibility**: Full screen reader support and ARIA attributes
- **Performance Optimized**: 60fps scrolling with hardware acceleration
- **Error Handling**: Robust error boundaries and fallback mechanisms

## Architecture

The implementation consists of several key components:

### Core Components

1. **Navbar Component** (`src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`)
   - Main navigation component with mobile menu
   - Integrates all scrolling functionality

2. **Mobile Menu Utilities** (`src/lib/mobileMenuUtils.ts`)
   - Height calculation and viewport detection
   - Configuration management

3. **React Hooks**
   - `useMobileMenuDimensions`: Responsive height management
   - `useScrollState`: Scroll state tracking and indicators
   - `useMobileMenuKeyboard`: Enhanced keyboard navigation
   - `useTouchGestures`: Touch gesture support

4. **Performance Utilities** (`src/lib/performanceUtils.ts`)
   - Performance monitoring and optimization
   - Error boundaries and memory management

5. **Accessibility Utilities** (`src/lib/accessibility.ts`)
   - Screen reader support and ARIA attributes
   - Focus management and announcements
